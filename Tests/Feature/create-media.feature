Feature: Form testing
  In order to send a message
  As a User
  I want to make sure that the form is correctly sent

  @javascript @create @media
  Scenario: User can create a new media
    Given I am on the main page
#      And I should see "New"
#      And I fill in the following:
#        | mailformtitle     | Mr.              |
#        | mailformfirstname | Fabien           |
#        | mailformlastname  | Udriot           |
#        | mailformemail     | fabien@ecodev.ch |
#      And I press "Add"
#    Then I should see "Ok"
